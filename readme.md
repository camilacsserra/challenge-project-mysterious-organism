# Mystery Organism Project

This project involves creating a set of objects representing mysterious organisms with DNA-related functionalities. The organisms are generated randomly, and their properties, mutations, and comparisons are explored. This is a challenge proposed by Codecademy as practice to improve skills with JavaScript in the Front-End Career Path.


## Introduction

The Mystery Organism project simulates the behavior of organisms with DNA. It includes functionalities such as random DNA generation, mutation, DNA comparison, and survival likelihood assessment.

## Features

- Random generation of DNA bases (A, T, C, G).
- Creation of a single strand of DNA with 15 bases.
- Mutation of organisms by randomly modifying a DNA base.
- Comparison of DNA between two organisms, displaying the percentage of common bases.
- Assessment of an organism's likelihood to survive based on the presence of certain DNA bases.
